## My Process


### Built With 

- HTML 
- CSS
- Bootstrap 5.1.3
### What I Learned 

I learned how to realign content using different viewport sizes 
with bootstrap. For example, if I want to align a paragraph to the center
for mobile devices and tablets, I would use `text-center`. However, If 
I want to realign the paragraph to the left on larger viewports, 
such as a desktop; I would use `text-lg-start`. 

### Continued Development 

Over time, I hope to become more comfortable building 
multi-section landing pages. 


### Useful Resources 

[Bootstrap Text Alignment](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/text/) - This helped me learn how to realign text using different viewport sizes.
